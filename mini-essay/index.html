    <h1><span class="time">09:57</span>  <span class="name">@un1cornluv3r</span> now live…</h1>

    <p> Beep. Beep. Beep.</p>
    <p>A buzzing in my ear drones on into a clear alarm. I awaken and force my crusty eyes open. They focus on my window, dark grey peaking through the slits in my blinds. It's the year 2125, but more importantly today is my twenty-first birthday. I get out of my bed and let my covers fall off me onto the ground, joining the rest of the clutter on the floor. I step over piles of clothes, wrappers, and mystery splotches; all which I have promised myself to clean up, as I make my way to my bathroom. I rub my eyes to see a blurry view of myself before turning on my mirror. As my eyes adjust to the light I am greeted with my perfected avatar face, erasing the monster I saw a few seconds ago. A flashing message blinks above me, “HAPPY BIRTHDAY!” as confetti falls behind me in the reflection. I pull at my face and then smile. I rub my eyes once more before I begin getting ready for the day.</p>

    <p>I swallow down the last of the birthday breakfast I had ordered last night and begin to pace around my kitchenette. I’m supposed to meet my friends at 12:00 but every second feels like eternity. As I pace my eyes look outside the window above my sink. There’s a dusty haze looming over my street. With the unbearable 100+ temperatures since 2100, and the current tree shortage, going outside has been an inconvenience. Thankfully I subscribed to MealMaid so all my meals are delivered straight from TheNet to my pod. I grab an Everything Shake from my fridge and decide to wait in my NetChair™ instead of pacing around. I settle into its body grooves and eagerly wait for the minutes to pass. I stare at the NetHelmet™ hovering next to my head, its goggles reflecting the colorful lights omitted from the computer in front of me. I decide to enter early and pull the helmet over my head.</p>
	<p>Connecting…</p>

    <h1><span class="time">11:51</span> <span class="name">@un1cornluv3r</span> connected to TheNet</h1>

    <p>	It's a beautiful day in TheNet. Warm yellow sunlight is pouring through my base window, and I hurry out of the door to feel it on my skin. When I walk out it feels a bit too hot so I open settings to adjust the weather to a cool 75°. Much better, I think as I continue my stroll towards my message inbox. I open it to have hundreds of messages pop into my view, voices overlapping as they read out to me and animations going off every second. I wait for them all to die down and then shift through my inbox, skimming over the senders searching for the one. </p>
	<p>	“Hey Net, any new messages from Hazel?” I ask.</p>
	<p>	“No new messages” it clanks back. I somberly walk away from my inbox, as an update alerts me in the corner of my view. </p>

    <h1><span class="time">11:56</span> <span class="name">@un1cornluv3r</span> happiness levels <span class="negative">-150</span></h1>

    <p>I dismiss the alert and let out a deep sigh. I open up the network and let the videos autoscroll. Top Ten Games to play this week on TheNet, Did you see the viral net trend that's sweeping the web?, How to Connect - A Net Knowledge special, Customize the Cutest NetPet™! I was midway through a NetNews update when a blue button appeared in front of me. Join Now! it blinked and I quickly pressed on it. </p>

    <h1><span class="time">12:00</span> <span class="name">@un1cornluv3r</span> joined [21st Birthday Bash] experience</h1>

    <p>	I jolt back as I am dropped into a disco room. It's a dark blue velvet floored room with flashes of color piercing through and a constant glitter disco ball illuminating the dance floor. One by one my friends drop into the room, wishing me a happy birthday. @st4rgurlll_ gives me a virtual hug and places a gift into my inventory.</p>
	<p>“Hope you like it! If not i’ll just forward you something else later, so let me know”</p>
	<p>“I’m sure I'll love it, thank you @st4rgurlll_” I exclaim back. My inventory slowly starts to fill as each of my friends drops a gift into it, so much so the sound effects start to ring in my ear. @mattieReal promises he’s the last of it as I finally am able to close my inventory and get the party started. We all submit song choices to the cloud as a virtual DJ starts to increase the volume. I open up my emote panel and click the dances I rehearsed a couple days ago. My friends cheer and send reactions to my dance, and @bear445 begins to record the experience. 
    “@bear445 make sure to not let it record for too long or we’ll hog the cloud” I joke to him. </p>

    <h1><span class="time">12:18</span> <span class="name">@un1cornluv3r</span> happiness levels <span class="positive">+80</span></h1>

    <p> We continue to emote as the DJ suggests more personalized songs to keep the happiness levels of the party up. I open the experience settings and change the room into a stage as @vampy1a and @mattieReal start singing along. The lyrics pop up behind them and we all partake in a round of karaoke. I monitor my score as the hologram column fills each line I sing. It’s my solo turn now and I begin to record my microphone and audio.</p>
    <p>DOIN Doin doin…</p>

    <h1><span class="time">12:46</span> <span class="name">@un1cornluv3r</span> disconnected from TheNet</h1>

    <p>I open my eyes to the darkness of my goggles. Quickly I yank them off and rush to my computer to see what happened. A “EMPTY BATTERY” alert flashes back onto my distraught face.</p>
    <p>“Dammit”. In all my excitement I forgot to charge my NetHelmet™. I search through the trash on my floor for a charging port and scramble to plug it in. I stare blankly at my darkened set up and decide to go back to my bed. As I sit on its edge I watch the brown haze roll by my window and I wait for my helmet to recharge.</p>
